# Face Recognition System UI/UX Python CV Project

This project is a Python-based Face Recognition System with a user-friendly graphical interface designed using Computer Vision techniques. The system allows users to perform face recognition tasks efficiently. Below, you'll find an overview of the project along with instructions for installation and usage.

## Overview

The Face Recognition System utilizes the OpenCV library for face detection and recognition tasks. It provides a simple yet effective UI/UX designed to facilitate easy interaction with the system. The system can perform the following key functionalities:

- Face Detection: Detects faces in images or live video streams.
- Face Recognition: Recognizes known faces based on a pre-trained model.
- User Management: Allows users to add, remove, and update known faces in the database.
- Logging: Logs system activities for review and analysis.
